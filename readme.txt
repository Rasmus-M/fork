Use joystick 1 to control your ship. Keyboard cannot be used.

Go to the location indicated at the bottom of the screen and pick up the star to advance to the next level.

Shoot or avoid the enemies.

Hitting the balls will earn points but will throw you off in the opposite direction.

For each level the star will move further away and more enemies will appear.

Extra lives can be found from time to time.

If the time runs out you lose the game.
