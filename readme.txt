Instructions:

Use joystick 1 to control your 'ship'. The keyboard cannot be used for control.

Press fire to start.

Move to the location indicated at the bottom of the screen, and pick up the star to advance to the next level.

Shoot or avoid the enemies.

Crashing into the balls will earn you points, but will also make you bounce in the opposite direction.

As you reach higher levels, the star will move further away and more enemies will appear.

Extra lives can be found from time to time.

If the time runs out you lose a life and the level is restarted. When you lose all your lives the game ends.
