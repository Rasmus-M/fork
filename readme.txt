Instructions:

You are in charge of 'Fork', a tri-fighter on a deathly mission to penetrate enemy territory and steal their most valued bonus stars.
Fortunately your fighter is equipped with an advanced GPS (Get Position of Star) that allows you to know the location of each star,
and a blob gun to help keep those enemies out of your path.

* Use joystick 1 to control your fighter. The keyboard cannot be used for control.

* Steer your tri-fighter to the location indicated by the GPS, and pick up the star to advance to the next level.

* The faster you complete a level, the more points you will earn.

* Avoid the square mines, or shoot them for extra points.

* Crashing into the buffer balls will make your fighter bounce off in the opposite direction. This will earn you a few points.

* As you reach higher levels, the stars will be harder to find, and more mines will appear.

* Extra lives can be picked up from time to time.

* If time runs out you lose a life, and the level is restarted. If all lives are lost the game ends.
